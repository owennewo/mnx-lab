# Research log

The entry point to the performance-listening experiment. It answers three questions
for a person or a resuming loop driver: what do we currently believe, on what evidence,
and what is the next question. It is the only file in the experiment that is rewritten
in place. No other document restates the current state: the README, the report index
and the evidence records link here instead. `ledger.md` holds the history, one
append-only row per run; `research/` holds one note per source read; a run's report
holds its numbers. This file points at all three and repeats none of them.

This log began on 2026-09-30 with [development contract 2](contracts/development-contract-2.md).
The first series, experiments 001–021 under contract 1, is archived in
[archive/ladder-1/](archive/ladder-1/README.md), with its own
[research log](archive/ladder-1/RESEARCH_LOG.md). Only the lessons below carry over.

How to maintain it:

- **Current state** is a few sentences, rewritten whenever an experiment lands. It says
  where the work stands, which listener is current, and what the last result changed.
  No figures.
- **Findings** are one row each. A finding states a belief and cites the evidence that
  supports it: a research note, a ledger row, or a per-experiment write-up. A row
  without evidence is a hypothesis and belongs under open questions instead. When
  later evidence contradicts a finding, its status becomes `superseded` and the row
  gains the evidence that did it; the row is never deleted or reworded to fit.
- **Open questions** are ranked by the contract's order of work first, then by how much
  uncertainty an answer would remove. The top row is the next question. A question
  that becomes a finding moves down with its evidence; one that a budget closes is
  marked `stopped`, with the reason.
- A finding's numbers stay in the report it cites.
- Every commit that adds a ledger row updates this file in the same commit, even if
  the update is only to the current-state paragraph.
- **This file is the handover.** Each experiment may be run by a different model, and
  the incoming model reads this whole file, including the inherited lessons, before
  choosing its question. A model's private memory is not handover state.
  [APPROACH.md](APPROACH.md#who-runs-an-experiment-one-model-one-experiment) sets out
  the procedure.

## Current state

2026-09-30. [Development contract 2](contracts/development-contract-2.md) is in force,
with the gates the user approved for the sine stages 1–3.
[Experiment 023](reports/023-instruments-decisions.md) put the user's decisions on 022
into the instruments: [event instruments 2](contracts/event-instruments-2.md) judges
variation against the player's typical tempo, interval durations to ±10% or ±30 ms, zero
false findings on clean examples, a distinct `dead` verdict (vocabulary 2.1) with
intended dead notes matched, and the approved gates as `stage-gates@1`. They reproduce
the hand-worked, frozen **event-oracle@2** exactly, and **that oracle now awaits its
audit** by a different session before any listener is judged by it. Stage 1 now carries
its controls, frozen as the private set `contract2-stage1-v2`: the clock fails every one,
so stage 1 now separates listening from following; the frozen time warpers reject
silence but follow the wrong score where its notes sit a semitone from the audio's.
There is still no listener built for this contract, and none passes stage 1.

**Awaiting the user** ([report 023](reports/023-instruments-decisions.md#for-the-user-two-decisions-and-one-observation)):
approval of the proposed control-assessment gate and the exclusion of controls from the
pooled finding rates, and whether the wrong score `w1` stays as stage 1's control. The
first new listener is **024**, after the audit.

No plateau: neither 022 nor 023 developed a listener.
[Report 023](reports/023-instruments-decisions.md#resulting-plateau-budgets-and-evidence-access)
records the budget state. Qualification under
[research contract 1](contracts/research-contract-1.md) is untouched, with zero frozen
versions and zero assessments; its six version slots, twelve assessment slots and
reserved and final access remain unused. Winner bars 5–8 remain unexamined.

## Inherited lessons

What the first series established that still applies. Each is evidence about sound,
alignment or measurement, not about the old objective. The archive holds the details.

| # | Lesson | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Develop on audio with an exact answer first. On a real recording, a tracking defect and an acoustic limit produce the same failure. | [Report 004](archive/ladder-1/reports/004-rung0-clean-winner.md), archived findings 20–21 |
| L2 | Matching the current sound against static templates ties with nearby positions in repeated harmony; the order of events is what disambiguates. | [Report 003](archive/ladder-1/reports/003-recognition-at-sync.md), [report 005](archive/ladder-1/reports/005-online-time-warp-rung0.md), archived findings 18, 22, 26 |
| L3 | Support judged from the current sound alone accepts a different piece that shares sustained notes. | [Report 005](archive/ladder-1/reports/005-online-time-warp-rung0.md), archived finding 25 |
| L4 | Recorded guitar against a sine reference shifts every absolute match threshold, in both directions depending on the guitar. A threshold is only meaningful per timbre, or relative to the performance itself. | [Report 008](archive/ladder-1/reports/008-rung2-guitar-samples.md), [report 009](archive/ladder-1/reports/009-plucked-reference.md), archived findings 28, 31, 34 |
| L5 | Frame alignment on recorded guitar fails in short bursts while sustained bass notes decay, even where the features prefer the true position. | [Report 008](archive/ladder-1/reports/008-rung2-guitar-samples.md), [report 010](archive/ladder-1/reports/010-slim-suite-and-burst-features.md), archived findings 32, 37 |
| L6 | Steady-tempo assumptions help exactly timed synthetic audio and hurt real playing: a four-second tempo history improved the synthetic guitars while real-clip agreement fell sharply. Making the path react faster made its bursts worse. | [Report 011](archive/ladder-1/reports/011-path-and-support.md), [report 021](archive/ladder-1/reports/021-stability-calibration.md), archived findings 38, 53, 54 |
| L7 | Comparing against one rearranged copy of the score is a coin flip on unrelated audio; a family of them is correlated and expensive. | [Report 015](archive/ladder-1/reports/015-decoy-null.md), archived findings 44, 46 |
| L8 | Rejection of a wrong score means nothing without acceptance of the right one; read them together. | [Report 004](archive/ladder-1/reports/004-rung0-clean-winner.md), archived finding 23 |
| L9 | The real clip's sync anchors are bar-level and of unmeasured precision. Interpolated positions cannot grade anything finer than a bar, and an audio-ignoring clock scores highly on a steady professional. | [Report 002](archive/ladder-1/reports/002-winner-sync-proxy.md), [anchor precision](evidence/bar-anchor-precision-1.json), archived findings 13, 15 |
| L10 | The frozen v1 evaluator needs clip durations exact to 1e-9 s: pad audio to a multiple of 3 samples at 48 kHz. | [Report 007](archive/ladder-1/reports/007-rung1-tempo.md), archived finding 30 |
| L11 | A development limit fitted on the examples it is scored on, against one wrong piece, is not independent evidence. Fresh bars, pieces or sounds are. | [Report 016](archive/ladder-1/reports/016-windowed-rank.md), archived finding 47 |

## Findings

Status is `holds`, `superseded` or `withdrawn`.

| # | Finding | Evidence | Status | Since | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | following-evaluator@2 and assessment-evaluator@1 reproduce every number of the hand-worked event-oracle@1, which covers every rule named in contract 2, and the oracle catches deliberate evaluator faults | [Report 022](reports/022-event-instruments.md#the-instruments-against-their-oracle), [oracle](bench/oracle-events/README.md) | holds | 022 | The oracle was frozen before the evaluators existed |
| 2 | On stage 1, the frozen time warpers' only failure is running ahead: at half speed all three reach events 0.15–0.9 s before they sound, and v12 and v14 are also ahead at 70% and 110% | [Report 022](reports/022-event-instruments.md#the-baselines-on-stage-1); superseded by [report 023](reports/023-instruments-decisions.md#the-baselines-on-the-controls) | superseded | 022 | Supports the contract's forward-only, tempo-clamped prediction; no deviation yet, so nothing about smoothing is concluded. Stage 1 had no controls; with them, running ahead is not their only failure (finding 8) |
| 3 | At the handed tempo, stage 1 cannot tell any listener from the clock: the sine audio is the time warpers' own reference, and their event timelines equal the clock's | [Report 022](reports/022-event-instruments.md#the-baselines-on-stage-1) | holds | 022 | The off-tempo examples carry stage 1 |
| 4 | How a continuous position maps to an event decides a baseline's score: under a nearest-onset mapping the clock at the handed tempo falls from 100% to 55–60% on event | [Report 022](reports/022-event-instruments.md#the-baselines-on-stage-1) | holds | 022 | The scored rule (the last onset reached) was fixed before any run |
| 5 | Under the contract's definition of variation, a single long hesitation in a short piece lowers the overall tempo enough that steady bars must be flagged fast | Oracle case A3, [report 022](reports/022-event-instruments.md#for-the-user-three-decisions-the-evidence-raises); superseded by the user's decision and [event-oracle@2's A3](reports/023-instruments-decisions.md#the-instruments-against-their-oracle) | superseded | 022 | A definitional question for the user, not a listener result. The user chose the typical (median) tempo; against it the steady bar is no longer flagged |
| 6 | assessment-evaluator@2 and stage-gates@1, with the unchanged following-evaluator@2, reproduce every number and gate verdict of the hand-worked event-oracle@2, which implements every decision the user made on 022; event-oracle@1 still passes, and seven injected faults are each caught | [Report 023](reports/023-instruments-decisions.md#the-instruments-against-their-oracle), [oracle](bench/oracle-events/README.md) | holds | 023 | Pending the audit (question 6): author and oracle agree by construction until an independent reading does |
| 7 | Stage 1's controls separate following from listening: the clock falsely follows every silence and wrong-score control for their whole answerable time, and the frozen time warpers reject every silence control | [Report 023](reports/023-instruments-decisions.md#the-baselines-on-the-controls), [g023](runs/g023-stage1-controls/summary.json) | holds | 023 | Qualifies finding 3, which is about the performances alone |
| 8 | The frozen time warpers follow a wrong score whose notes lie a semitone from the audio's in the same rhythm: `w1` against s2's second bar at 90 and 99, for 0.41–1.65 s (correct rejection 64.5–91.9%), with the path two and a half to four quarters behind; where `w1`'s notes are a tritone or more away, or the audio is at 45 or 63, they reject it | [Report 023](reports/023-instruments-decisions.md#the-baselines-on-the-controls) | holds | 023 | Same family as lesson L3; the mechanism (semitone leakage, a two-second rank window) is inferred from the code, not tested |
| 9 | In a two-bar piece the bar with more intervals sets the typical tempo, so a second bar that drags throughout makes a steady first bar read fast | Oracle case A7, [report 023](reports/023-instruments-decisions.md#for-the-user-two-decisions-and-one-observation) | holds | 023 | A consequence of the approved definition, reported to the user; not a listener result |

## Open questions

Ranked by row order; the top row is the next question. The number is an identifier
given when a question opens and never reused.

| Rank | Question | Why it is ranked here | Status | Owner item |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | Does an independent session, re-deriving **event-oracle@2** by hand from [event instruments 2](contracts/event-instruments-2.md), agree with it? | No listener is judged by an unaudited oracle; 023 re-versioned it | open | [The audit rule](contracts/development-contract-2.md#auditing-an-oracle) and [AUDITING_AN_ORACLE.md](AUDITING_AN_ORACLE.md); the audit goes in `bench/oracle-events/audit-2.md` |
| 7 | Does the user approve the proposed control-assessment gates (`claims`, `tempo`) and the exclusion of controls from the pooled finding rates, and does `w1` stay as stage 1's wrong score? | Needed before 024's assessment of a control can be passed or failed; `w1` turned out to be a semitone neighbour of s2's second bar (finding 8) | awaiting the user | [Report 023](reports/023-instruments-decisions.md#for-the-user-two-decisions-and-one-observation) |
| 4 | Can the simplest event-based live cursor and end-of-piece assessor pass stage 1, controls included? | The first listener, once event-oracle@2 is audited | open | [Contract 2 order of work](contracts/development-contract-2.md#order-of-work), experiment 024, on `contract2-stage1-v2` |
| 5 | Do the instruments, versioned for the user's decisions (typical-tempo reference, interval durations with a floor, clean examples, the dead verdict, the controls), reproduce a re-worked hand oracle, and what do the frozen baselines do on stage 1's new controls? | Answered: yes, exactly (finding 6); the clock fails every control and the time warpers fail two wrong-score controls (findings 7, 8) | answered | [Report 023](reports/023-instruments-decisions.md) |
| 1 | Do following-evaluator@2 and assessment-evaluator@1 reproduce independently hand-worked oracle cases? | Answered: yes, exactly (finding 1) | answered | Experiment 022 |
| 2 | On stage 1, where do the clock and the frozen versions 8, 12 and 14 fail, and do the failures show the forward-only, tempo-clamped design? | Answered: ahead of a slow player; indistinguishable at the handed tempo (findings 2–3) | answered | Experiment 022 |
| 3 | Which numerical gates, flag reference tempo and dead-note verdict does the user approve? | Decided by the user after 022 | answered: gates approved for stages 1–3 with two changes; typical tempo; a dead verdict | [Report 022](reports/022-event-instruments.md#proposed-gates-awaiting-the-users-approval) |

## Superseded and stopped

| # or rank | Was | Superseded or stopped by | Date |
|---|---|---|---|
| Finding 2 | The time warpers' only stage-1 failure is running ahead | Finding 8: with controls, they also follow a semitone-neighbour wrong score ([report 023](reports/023-instruments-decisions.md)) | 2026-09-30 |
| Finding 5 | A hesitation makes steady bars read fast | The user's typical-tempo decision, implemented in event instruments 2 ([report 023](reports/023-instruments-decisions.md)) | 2026-09-30 |
