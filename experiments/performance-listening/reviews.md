# Process reviews

One entry per process review, appended after each experiment, audit or batch, following
[REVIEWING_THE_PROCESS.md](REVIEWING_THE_PROCESS.md). The table is the index; each review
has a short section below it. Append-only: a later review that disagrees with an earlier
one says so in its own entry.

**Rules ±** counts the process rules a review added and removed or relaxed, so the trend
is visible: a process that gains rules every time is getting heavier, not better.

Reviews R1–R3 were given in conversation with the user and recorded here when this file
was created. The same reviewer wrote contract 2 and most of the process it reviewed.

## R1, after experiment 022

**Held.** The pre-registration landed before any evaluator code, with the hand-worked
oracle frozen in it; the pre-registration and every frozen file were unchanged
afterwards. The baselines' position-to-event mapping was fixed before they ran, with a
second, unscored mapping measuring how much the choice decides (40–45 points). A
contradicted prediction was recorded plainly, and a disclosed miscount (26 against 28
records). The oracle test was shown to bite by breaking two rules deliberately.

**Weaknesses.** The oracle and the evaluators had one author, so a shared misreading of
the rules would have been invisible: independent in procedure, not authorship. And the
final contract text had dropped the negative controls, the reviewer's own omission,
so stage 1 had no stretch where "not following" was the right answer.

**Fixed** in 1ed5e911 and the follow-up d23f27b3: the oracle audit
rule and [AUDITING_AN_ORACLE.md](AUDITING_AN_ORACLE.md); controls restored to every
stage; versioned instrument definitions allowed as contract files (a relaxation); the
optional parent-session runner. **Decided by the user:** gates approved for stages 1–3
with a duration floor and zero false findings on clean examples; variation judged
against the typical tempo; a distinct dead-note verdict.

## R2, after experiment 023 and audit 2

**Held.** Order, freezing and versioning were all correct; version-1 instruments and
oracle untouched; seven deliberate faults each failed the new oracle test. The audit ran
on a different model (Claude Fable 5.1), after 023 landed, checked all 66 records, and
recorded one honest ambiguity rather than choosing a reading. The parent session stopped
before 024.

**Findings.** The audit left the research log's current state stale, a gap in the audit
prompt. The wrong score `w1` was a semitone near miss, not unrelated: a hard control on
the happy-path stage, which 023 found and put to the user itself. The audit's ambiguity
needed settling without an oracle change, to avoid a re-audit loop. 023 edited 022's
label module in place (version 1 still reproduced) and the audit touched one README cell.

**Fixed** in 743f2b92: the audit prompt now updates the current state and may fill in the
oracle README's audit entry (a relaxation); the ambiguity settled by a clarification in
event instruments 2 that changes no number; stage 1's wrong score must be distant, by a
checkable rule. **Decided by the user:** the control-assessment gate approved; `w1`
moved to stage 2.

## R3, after experiment 024

**Held, the cleanest run yet**, by a different tool: Sol 6.1 (high) in Codex followed the
repository's procedure unaided. Order, integrity and reuse checks were all correct, with
baseline records byte-identical to 023's. The listener's unit tests used ideal tones and
hand-made sequences, not the stage-1 material, so its predictions were real ones. It
disclosed its own departure (set builder and listener written before the freeze, with
no listener run), flagged its vacuous pooled gates and easy control, and stopped before
stage 2.

**Findings.** Model identity was recorded vaguely, because a model often cannot verify
its own version. Its commits had subject lines only. Each stage passed by the simplest
possible listener risks a string of throwaway designs (this one's pitch detector works
only on pure sines).

**Fixed** in de3ef9cb: whoever launches a session states its model and tool, recorded as
stated; commits carry a short body naming them; each report's Next names what should
survive the coming stages; 024's attribution corrected. **Trend:** R1–R3 added eight rules
and relaxed two. The next reviews should add fewer, and look for any not earning their
place.

## R4, after experiment 025

The first review run from [REVIEWING_THE_PROCESS.md](REVIEWING_THE_PROCESS.md). Light
review, sections 3.1–3.3 and 3.5, with a look at direction.

**Held.** The pre-registration landed at 17:30:55, before the set builder, the freeze
or the runner. Codex's session log shows the order the report claims: builder, freeze
(`freeze.json` 17:33:14), then the runner, derived from 024's by substitution, then the
run one second after its commit. No lines were removed from the pre-registration. The
only bench files that changed are two new ones. Recomputed hashes match: the
`contract2-hesitation-v1` manifest (`acf11389…`) and all 99 of its assets, and the
stage-1 v1–v3 manifests and v3's 19 assets. `export-report --check` passes for
022–025. The worktree and branch are gone. The report is candid: it measures the
10–20 ms abstention when sound resumes even though the gate passes, and it does not
credit the pause for baseline failures whose parents already failed. It calls the new
examples correlated transformations of two scores and makes no generalisation claim.

**Findings.**

- **Model identity is vague again, after R3's fix.** The record says "GPT-6 in Codex
  (exact version unverified)". Codex's session record says `gpt-6.1-sol`, effort
  `high`: Sol 6.1 (high), the same as 024. The user launched a Codex parent without
  naming a model, and the parent passed on what its instructions told it ("based on
  GPT-6"). Asking the launcher did not fix this, because the launcher could not see the
  answer either. The tool's own log could.
- **A run's pinned commit can be orphaned.** 02237d15 landed during 025, so the
  landing rebase rewrote the commit the run had pinned (`ed842e7e`). The experimenter
  noticed and pushed an annotated tag, `g025-single-hesitation-source`. Without the
  tag, the exporter would have fallen back to the working tree and failed once those
  files were next edited. 024 was spared only because `main` did not move while it ran.
- **Runs and records are getting heavier.** Wall time went 30, 74, 75, then 365 s from
  022 to 025. The HTML report went 0.15, 0.47, 0.87, then 5.0 MB, and the run summary
  0.09, 0.33, 0.64, then 3.8 MB. The exporter embeds the whole summary in the HTML, so
  every run is committed twice. Most of the time goes to the frozen time warpers
  (sustained ratio about 0.2, against event-chain's 0.002). They reran all 24 stage-1
  regressions only to reproduce their g024 records byte for byte.
- **Budget restatement is heavy.** The pre-registration, results and log each restate
  qualification budgets that have not moved since 022.
- **Direction.** The loop measures what the user asked for: 025 reports the user's own
  example (s2 at 45 with a 1 s pause) as a slow overall tempo with only bar 2 flagged.
  But 025's prediction came from reading unchanged code, and every prediction held. The
  pause was digital silence after the note's written end, the easiest hesitation there
  is. A hesitation on a held note, which is what a guitarist does, remains untested. The
  report's limits come close to saying so ("no claim for … ringing guitar"). Stage 2 has
  eight more single deviations on pure sines. Several, the slowed and rushed bar for
  a start, look passable by construction. At one experiment each, with regressions
  growing, the loop risks slow confirmation, not discovery. No real-music thermometer
  has run under contract 2; with a sine-only pitch front end it would say nothing yet.

**Fixed** directly: [RUNNING_AN_EXPERIMENT.md](RUNNING_AN_EXPERIMENT.md) now has a run
tag its pinned commit `<run-id>-source` and push the tag (+1). It lets an unchanged
listener, such as a frozen baseline, cite its earlier records by hash instead of
rerunning them (a relaxation, −1). It lets unchanged budgets be one line (a relaxation,
−1). [REVIEWING_THE_PROCESS.md](REVIEWING_THE_PROCESS.md) now checks model identity
against the tool's session log, and has the reviewer update the research log's
"review due" sentence (+1; the audit prompt had the same gap in R2). 025's attribution
and ledger row now carry the session record's identification, added beside the
original.

**Escalated to the user:**

1. **An outside review of the process by a different model.** This is the fourth review.
   All four were by Claude Opus 5.5, which also drafted contract 2 and most of the
   process. Section 4 asks for one every third review.
2. **Several single-deviation substages in one experiment.** Each example would still
   carry exactly one deviation. A listener change would still get an experiment of its
   own. This changes the order of work, so it is the user's call. Recommended for
   deviations the unchanged listener is predicted to pass.
3. **Report weight.** Recommended: the exporter links the run summary instead of
   embedding it, and summaries keep per-example detail in the private records, named by
   hash. This is tooling, not a contract, but it changes what a reader of a report can
   see without the private data.

**Could not check:** whether the parent's prompt to the subagent named a model. Codex
stores that message encrypted.

**Trend:** R1–R4 added ten rules and relaxed four. This review added as many as it
relaxed.
